I have been teaching physics at Avon High School since 2013. I also coach the school's Science Olympiad Team.
</p>

<p>
I have been fascinated by <code>html</code> since I was a kid, and I've taught myself <code>php</code>,
<code>JavaScript</code>, and some other languages. This website is just a place for me to play around 
with these programming languages and trick myself into thinking that I am being productive by doing so.
</p>

<p>
This website is built using <a href="https://www.gohugo.io/"><code>hugo</code></a> and a 
<a href="/projects/hugo/">custom-coded theme</a>.
