I have been teaching physics at Avon High School since 2013. I also coach the school's Science Olympiad Team.

This website is a collection of projects---some related to my job and many not.  Mostly, this website is just a 
place for me to play around with `html` and other programming languages and trick myself into thinking that I 
am being productive by doing so.

This website is built using [`hugo`](https://www.gohugo.io/) and a [custom-coded theme](/projects/hugo/).
