I have been teaching physics at Avon High School since 2013. I also coach the school's Science Olympiad Team.

I have been fascinated by `html` since I was a kid, and I've taught myself `php`,
`JavaScript`, and some other languages. This website is just a place for me to play around 
with these programming languages and trick myself into thinking that I am being productive by doing so.

This website is built using [`hugo`](https://www.gohugo.io/) and a [custom-coded theme](/projects/hugo/).
