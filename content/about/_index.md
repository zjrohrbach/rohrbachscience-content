I have been teaching physics at Avon High School since 2013. I also coach the school's Science Olympiad Team.

# Why do I need a website?

The short answer is, I don't. There are rare occasions in which it is helpful to post lessons online (for, example when I have a [substitute](../sub-plans/)), but I use [Schoology](https://www.schoology.com) for most of my online teaching needs.

In reality, I have long been fascinated by `html` since I was a kid and I've taught myself `php`, `JavaScript`, and some other languages. This website is just a place for me to play around with these programming languages and trick myself into thinking that I am being productive by doing so.

This website is built [`hugo`](https://www.gohugo.io) and a custom-coded theme.
