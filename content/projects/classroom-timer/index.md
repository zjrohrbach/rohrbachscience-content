This project exists to serve a very niche problem.  In my classroom, students coming from across my rather large school have trouble making it to my room before passing period ends.  Therefore, I give them an extra 45 seconds after the bell rings before I count them tardy.  I also don't allow students to pack up prior to three minutes before the end of the period.  So, I wanted a script that would sound an alarm bell 45 seconds after the beginning of each period and 3 minutes prior to the end of the period.
