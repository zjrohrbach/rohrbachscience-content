When my first daughter was born, we were asked by the doctor to track her feedings and her wet and dirty diapers.  While there are apps that do this, they are all too complicated!  So I did the only logical thing: coded my own simpler app from scratch!  This 'app' is a collection of php scripts hosted on a Raspberry Pi on my local network.  It simply allows you to keep timestamps of 'poop', 'pee', and 'feed' events.
