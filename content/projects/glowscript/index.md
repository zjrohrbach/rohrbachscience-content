During the 2017 [INAAPT](https://www.inaapt.org) Spring Meeting, I listened to a talk about [GlowScript](https://www.glowscript.org/) as a way to create `VPython` animations online.  I created the following projects just to fool around. 

 * [Doppler Effect Animation](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/zachary.rohrbach/folder/Public/program/DopplerEffect) (_bug jumping on water_)
 * [Monkey & Hunter Animation](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/zachary.rohrbach/folder/Public/program/MonkeyandHunter)
 * [Bouncing Ball Animation](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/zachary.rohrbach/folder/Public/program/BouncingBall) (_My first animation, and just an attempt to understand how to code free fall_)
 * [Waves on a spring](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/zachary.rohrbach/folder/Public/program/WavesOnAString)  (_This was an experiment to see if I could explore a wave as a collection of particles that only interact with neighboring particles instead of as a continuous entity.  It has certain bugs that haven't been resolved yet_)
