The whole reason that this webite exists is to give me a toy to play with!  I wanted to understand how [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io/) works, so I made my own Hugo theme.

The code of this site lives in two repositories: You can find the theme [here](https://github.com/zjrohrbach/hugo-rohrbachsci) and the content [here](https://github.com/zjrohrbach/rohrbachscience-content).
