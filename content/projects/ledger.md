I use [Plain-Text Accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) and the command line tools [Ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/) and [HLedger](https://hledger.org/) in order to track family finances.  I have written these scripts to help me import data from monthly bank statements into my ledger file and visualize our finances.
