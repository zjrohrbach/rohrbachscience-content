In the summer of 2010, I had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Dennis Krause](https://www.wabash.edu/academics/profiles/home.cfm?site_folder=physics&vdeptid=29&facname=kraused) at Wabash College on a project he was considering attempting a theoretical treatment of interference of quantum unstable particles (QuUP).  This publication eventually came out of this project.

# Abstract

 If an unstable particle used in a two-path interference experiment decays before reaching a detector, which-way information becomes available that reduces the detected interference fringe visibility V. Here we argue that even when an unstable particle does not decay while in the interferometer, a priori which-way information is still available in the form of path predictability P which depends on the particle's decay rate Γ. We further demonstrate that in a matter-wave Mach–Zehnder interferometer using an excited atom with an appropriately tuned cavity, P is related to V through the duality relation P^2+V^2=1.
