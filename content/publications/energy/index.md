# Abstract

Following the derivation of kinetic and potential energy formulas in the Giancolli textbook, I have been stressing
to my students in recent years that energy is a made-up concept, and that--in principle--it is not necessary for
building a coherent model of interactions between objects. I discuss how energy is nothing more than a helpful
"bookkeeping method" for multi-object systems. This leads to interesting discussions, especially for students
who have already taken chemistry.
