summary: "We will use the geometric definitions of conic sections to explore the properties of concave, convex, and hyperbolic mirrors and then use this to demonstrate how holography takes advantage of wave interference in order to construct what is essentially a geometric phenomenon."

# Abstract

We will use the geometric definition of a parabola to explore the properties of concave and convex mirrors. We will then expand this discussion to explore the properties of a hyperbolic mirror. Finally, we will demonstrate how a holography takes advantage of the hyperbolic nature of wave interference in order to construct what is essentially a geometric phenomenon.
