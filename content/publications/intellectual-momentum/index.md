I gave this talk to the Physics Department at Wabash College (my alma mater) in October, 2014.

# Abstract

I had always known that I wanted to teach, but as I prepared to graduate from Wabash, I was hesitant to follow through on that plan.  My four years of studying physics had opened my mind to a way of thinking I had grown to love and didn't want to give up.  Would teaching provide the same intellectual stimulation I had enjoyed in college?  Would covering the same introductory mechanics and splash of E&M year in and year out in my classes really scratch my physics itch?  In this talk, I will discuss what I have done to try to stay in touch with the field of physics and how--five years into my career--it has helped keep me happy in my job and made me a better teacher
