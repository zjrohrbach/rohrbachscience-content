Talk given at the Spring Meeting of the [Indiana Section of AAPT](http://www.inaapt.org/) in April, 2018.

# Abstract

There's been a schoolwide push at Avon for increased cross-curricular literacy instruction that I have long tried to ignore because I was afraid of the time it would take away from the physics curriculum. However, over the past two years I've hit upon some strategies that not only foster literacy skills in students but also seem to increase the interest-level and quality of classroom discussion about physics topics. In this talk, I will share some strategies and my experience integrating these strategies without giving up my prized physics instruction time.
