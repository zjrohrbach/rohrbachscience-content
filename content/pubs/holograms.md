Talk given at the Spring Meeting of the [Indiana Section of AAPT](http://www.inaapt.org/) in April, 2019.

# Abstract

We will use the geometric definition of a parabola to explore the properties of concave and convex mirrors. We will then expand this discussion to explore the properties of a hyperbolic mirror. Finally, we will demonstrate how a holography takes advantage of the hyperbolic nature of wave interference in order to construct what is essentially a geometric phenomenon.
